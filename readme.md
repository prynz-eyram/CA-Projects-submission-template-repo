## Project Description
The project aims to develop a robust time series forecasting model that can accurately predict unit sales for various items sold at Favorita stores. The data set is challenging and complex, with thousands of items sold at different stores. The model will use statistical and machine learning techniques, including ARIMA, Linear regression, and Prophet, trained on historical sales data, and evaluated using performance metrics. Insights gained from the analysis will be used to make informed business decisions, including identifying high-demand products and stores and informing marketing and inventory decisions. Ultimately, the project seeks to optimize Favorita's sales strategies and improve its bottom line.
